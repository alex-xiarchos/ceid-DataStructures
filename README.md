# 📌 Data Structures Project
> This project explores fundamental data structures and algorithms, focusing on sorting, searching, BSTs, and hashing while analyzing their computational efficiency.


## 📜 About
The project involves:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort `O(n²)`, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort `O(n log n)` and performance benchmarking on 100,000 elements.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear Search `O(n)`, Binary Search `O(log n)`, Interpolation Search `O(log log n)`, Binary Interpolation Search
- **Binary Search Tree Implementations**:
  - BST Sorted by Student ID – Supports insertion, deletion, search, and modification
  - BST Sorted by Grades – Uses linked lists for duplicate grades.
- **Hash Table with Chaining**: Uses modular arithmetic hashing (stringToKey()) for student record lookup. Supports insert, search, modify, delete operations.
